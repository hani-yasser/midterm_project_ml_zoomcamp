Heart Attack Prediction Model
Heart disease, a prevalent global health concern, can benefit from data-driven insights. Leveraging machine learning, we aim to predict heart disease occurrence by analyzing medical histories, physiological measurements, and lifestyle factors. Through model training and evaluation, our study seeks to accurately differentiate patients with and without heart disease. Challenges include data quality and model complexity, demanding iterative refinement. This research aligns with the growing need for early detection, intervention, and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving cardiovascular healthcare outcomes.

Deployment
1.	Two Python files have been created: 'Heart.py' and 'Heart.ipynb.' The Python version used is 3.10.9
2.	After selecting the best model and running 'train.py,' you will see the following output message indicating that a file was created and saved 

3.	  Create a 'predict' file to load the model and use the 'waitress' command, as your environment is Windows and not Linux compatible.
 
4.	Open a new terminal and run 'predict-test.py
5.	Install 'pipenv' and add the required libraries. This will generate a 'Pipfile' and 'Pipfile.lock but for this project conda was used instead.
6.	Unfortunately, I couldn't create a Docker image, as I need to update Windows, and I don't have administrative privileges to do so
